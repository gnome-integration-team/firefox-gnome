# Notice

Due to fundamental changes in Firefox in 2017, theme support was dropped from the browser. Only "lightweight" wallpaper & color themes remain.

Reskinning Firefox now requires local CSS overrides.

We recommend using https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/firefox-gnome-theme for the best GNOME-like appearance.
